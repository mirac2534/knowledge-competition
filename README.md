# knowledge-competition
I have done project that is knowledge competition.
I used 4 functions in this project. They are menu, knowledge_competition_general_culture, knowledge_competition_technology, knowledge_competition_history.
Firstly, menu function is for you to choose process.
Another function, knowledge_competition_general_culture is for you to solve general culture questions.
Thirdly, knowledge_competition_technology function is for you to solve technology questions.
The last function, knowledge_competition_history is for you to solve history questions. 
Success already:)
